# VoyagerTF

External LOLTF with modded voyager connected.

"UNDETECTED" in P2C terms (once u change the aimbot method of course)

use modded pasteager for this shit to work (thanks chase)

Requirements:

- Secure Boot OFF
- Virtualization (AMD SVM/Intel VT-x) ON
- Windows 10 2004-22h2
- Hyper-V Enabled (pasteager should auto enable it)

Known Issues related to pasteager:

- Confirmed not working on win 10 revisions .2965 / .2913 (idk about others) Works on INTEL/AMD 19044.2006 [21H2] perfectly (REMEMBER TO CHANGE OFFSETS IN TYPES.H FOR AMD!!)
- EAC blocks memory reading on AMD (also happens on some intel machines) Works well on battleye.
- Battleye might sometimes give u an error related to virtual machine, happened to one of my users. Doesnt happen to me though.
- Wont work on WIN 11 / win 10 below 2004 due to signatures, but can be easily updated


anyways enjoy and dont sell this shit lol, but if u do atleast change aimbot from mouse_event to anything else.
