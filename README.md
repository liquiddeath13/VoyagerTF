# VoyagerTF


Known Issues related to pasteager:

- Confirmed not working on win 10 revisions .2965 / .2913 (idk about others) Works on INTEL/AMD 19044.2006 [21H2] perfectly (REMEMBER TO CHANGE OFFSETS IN TYPES.H FOR AMD!!)
- EAC blocks memory reading on AMD (also happens on some intel machines) Works well on battleye.
- Battleye might sometimes give u an error related to virtual machine, happened to one of my users. Doesnt happen to me though.


External LOLTF with modded voyager connected.

This is an open source project, pull requests are welcome.

use modded pasteager for this shit to work (thanks chase)

To be done:

- Fix EAC issues
- Add support for more winvers on AMD (hint: types.h in modded pasteager)
- Add spoofcalls or anything because this is UltraDetected


anyways enjoy and dont sell this shit lol.
